# Social Network with NodeJS, ReactJS + MongoDB
This project is a social network with basic features, but my wish is to add new features and also improve existing ones. The technologies used in this project are: NodeJS with its micro framework expressJS on the server side, on the client side it was developed with ReactJS and finally the database was created with MongoDB, in the future trying to add new technologies to make and improve the project.
